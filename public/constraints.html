	<h1>LDP.js</h1>

	<p>LDP.js is an LDP server built using <a
		href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and <a
		href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. It accepts most any RDF,
	but does have a few constraints:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>LDP.js does not yet support non-RDF source.</li>
		<li>LDP.js does not support ldp:IndirectContainer.</li>
		<li>Containers cannot be modified via PUT.</li>
		<li>The interaction model of a resource cannot be changed by modifying
		its rdf:type after creation. If the resource was created as RDF Source,
		it cannot be changed to a container.</li>
		<li>Deleting a container does not delete any of its resources.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: This service is provided as-is. It could go
		down at any time and change without warning. In fact, it might have
		already changed while you were reading this. The data behind this
		services will get scrubbed periodically. If this service gets abused,
